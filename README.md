The entire source code is given in the Jupyter Notebook on github. All cells in the notebook can be run separately to reproduce the results, as long as the first two cells including libraries and functions are run.

The notebook is organised in parts similar to the project, and should as such be self explanatory.

The report is found in the folder with the same name
